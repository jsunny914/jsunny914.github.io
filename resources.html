        <!--Brief overview of implicit bias-->
        <h2>1. Key Terms and Concepts</h2>
        <!-- Definition 1: Implicit Bias-->
        <h3>Defining Implicit Bias</h3>
        <p>
            Implicit biases are the subconscious attitudes and associations one holds against a specific social group. They are not innate, or intentional judgements, but rather deeply ingrained and learned associations shaped over time by one's environment - their experiences and/or background. Because these biases are, by their very nature, subconscious, it requires a great deal of self awareness to recognize, challenge, and mitigate them.

        <!--Definition 2: Intersectionality-->
        <h3>Defining Intersectionality</h3>
        <p>
            Intersectionality, a term coined by the legal scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw, is a framework for understanding how an individual's various identites (race, gender, class, sexuality, etc.) interact with each other to create unique forms of discrimination and privilege. Intersectionality means we cannot isolate only one identity (e.g., gender) from others (e.g., race) when analyzing social inequalities, as their effects are independent.

        <h2>Take the Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h2>
        <p>
            One of the best-known tools for measuring implicit bias is the Implicit Association Test (IAT), developed by researchers at Harvard University. Taking any one of these tests can be a valuable first step in understanding your own implicit biases.
