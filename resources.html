            Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions unconsciously. These biases, which include both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individual's awareness or intentional control.

        <p>
            One of the most well-known tools for measuring implicit bias is the Implicit Association Test (IAT), developed by researchers at Harvard University. Taking the test can be a valuable first step in understanding your own unconscious associations.
