        <!--Brief overview of implicit bias-->
        <p>
            Implicit biases are the subconscious attitudes and associations one holds against a specific social group. They are not innate, or intentional judgements, but rather deeply ingrained and learned associations shaped over time by one's environment - their experiences and/or background. Because these biases are, by their very nature, subconscious, it requires a great deal of self awareness to recognize, challenge, and mitigate them.

        <h2>Take the Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h2>
        <p>
            One of the best-known tools for measuring implicit bias is the Implicit Association Test (IAT), developed by researchers at Harvard University. Taking any one of these tests can be a valuable first step in understanding your own implicit biases.
