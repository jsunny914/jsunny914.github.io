            Implicit biases are the unconscious attitudes and associations one holds against a specific social group. They are not innate, but learned associations shaped by one's experiences and/or background. Because of their unconscious nature, it is important to acknowledge and challenge them. 

        <h2>Take the Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h2>
        <p>
            One of the best-known tools for measuring implicit bias is the Implicit Association Test (IAT), developed by researchers at Harvard University. Taking any one of these tests can be a valuable first step in understanding your own implicit biases.
