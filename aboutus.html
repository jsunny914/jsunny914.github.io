                  <p>Thomas Reineck (they/them) is a public historian, writer, and author of, "The Fledgling FÃ¼hrers: A Comparative Study of Interwar Fascist Movements in Britain and the U.S," available at Minds@UW. In 2023, they graduated from the UW-Eau Claire with a Master of Arts degree in Public History. They have over five years of experience in the field, through reference work in libraries, collection processing at historical societies, exhibition creation at museums, and archiving at universities. Presently, they are in their second year of UW-Madison's Library and Information Studies M.A. program. As a public historian, they strive to educate the public by providing access to decentered and multi-lensed histories, whether that be in the exhibition, or the archive.</p>
