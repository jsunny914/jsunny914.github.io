        <p>Dr. Heliana Ramirez, PhD, LISW, is a researcher of racial and LGBTQ+ related workplace trauma. She created the Black Woman Toxic Job Survivor Suicide Prevention Resource Guide. This guide is purely for research purposes, and not legal or clinical advice. After reading a news article highlighting the circumstances revolving around the tragic suicide of Dr. Antoinette Candia-Bailey, specifically bullying and workplace harassment, Ramirez was empowered to compile a list of alternative crisis resources that avoid police and maintain autonomy in one's environment and community, as well as a guide and a resource to defend against workplace abuse, find new employment, or start a business.</p>
      
        <!--Tech hero's creation-->
        <h3>About The Black Woman Toxic Survivor Suicide Prevention Resource Guide</h2>
        <p>The Black Woman Toxic Survivor Suicide Prevention Resource Guide is twenty pages, and broken down into five parts. The five parts are as follows: Mental Health Resources, Workplace Abuse Resources, Finding a New Job and Building Your Own Business, Toxic Job Recovery Songs, and then a brief annotated bibliography.</p>
        <p>When discussing the impetus for the creation of a resource like this, Ramirez noted in an interview with POCIT that "in the US, Black women ages 18 to 65 have the highest rate of suicide among all groups of women. But I was not seeing the concrete skills building and resource sharing that actually helps Black women in a moment of suicidal crisis." The Fawcett Society also conducted a study and published key findings supporting Ramirez's claims, stating, "72% of women in tech roles have experienced at least one form of sexism at work. This includes being paid less than male colleagues and sexist 'banter' (22%) and questioning of their skills and abilities (20%). Black and minoritised women have experienced additional levels of exclusion, with almost three in four having experienced racism at work. 1 in 3 Black women have been assumed by colleagues to not hold a technical role." Ramirez recommends that women facing these toxic workplace environments keep documentation of all interactions with supervisors and other employees, while also keeping on-hand resources like an employee handbook, a detailed outline of their job role and responsibilities, and to lean into positive relationships, whether with other clients or friends and family for support as one looks for new employment, etc.

        <h3>Honoring Dr. Antoinette Candia-Bailey</h3>

        <p>Dr. Antoinette Candia-Bailey was working as Vice President of Student Affairs at Lincoln University Oakland when she began experiencing severe workplace abuse from her supervisor. Although turning to the university council for help and also getting a signed note for FMLA leave from her family doctor, her leave was then denied, and her calls for help were ignored. Ultimately as a result, Candia-Bailey took her own life, and the important work Dr. Ramirez has done is in honor of her.</p>

        <p>Angelica Ross, an American actress, businesswoman, and transgender rights advocate, is the CEO of and founder of TransTech Social Enterprises, a non-profit firm dedicated to helping transgender people find professional tech careers. Recognizing the unique challenges and high unemployment rates within the trans community - often due to intersectional bias involving gender identity, race, and sexuality - Ross established TransTech in 2014 to provide job resources (e.g., workplace training and digital readiness) to trans and gender non-conforming people in the otherwise cisgender, white, male dominated tech industry.</p>
